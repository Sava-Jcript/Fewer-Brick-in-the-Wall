Let's Fight Fascism" is a thought-provoking game project designed with the singular purpose of shedding light on the persistent inequalities and injustices that have plagued societies for decades, if not centuries. 
The game aims to serve as a poignant reminder of the hardships faced by individuals due to persecution, harassment, torture, and genocides based on their beliefs, skin color, ideologies, or even culinary preferences that deviate from societal norms. Through immersive gameplay, players are encouraged to confront the harsh realities of historical and contemporary struggles, fostering empathy and understanding for the diverse experiences of those who have been marginalized.
The project strives to be a powerful medium for sparking conversations about social justice and promoting awareness of the ongoing fight against discrimination.
